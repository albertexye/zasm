Please generate Doxygen documentation for the given .c file.
The documentation should be clear, concise, and follow the Doxygen format.
Put the function declarations of the static functions at the top of the file, and document them.
Include descriptions for all static functions, parameters, return values, and any relevant notes or examples.
Don't document the exported functions as they are already documented in the .h file.
Don't document the static function implementations, only their declarations.
Add some inline comments in function bodies to clarify the logic where necessary.
Ensure that the documentation is suitable for developers who will be using or maintaining the code.
Also add docstrings for the entire file.
